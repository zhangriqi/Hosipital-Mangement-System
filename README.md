# Hosipital-Mangement-System


This is a simple hospital management system on android, using xampp to set up a local server, so remembe to replace the mock url in the code(RegisterActivity and LoginActivity). In the Server folder, you will find the database for the application and the server side php code.

Currently, the android app only supports patients to make an appointment, more features are implemented in the web application.
